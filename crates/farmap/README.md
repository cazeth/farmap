## Farmap

Farcaster data in your rust application. 

If you wish to use or analyze farcaster data this library might (eventually) be useful. It is currently under development. Some functionality, however, is useful at the current state. For now, the library supports Warpcast spam labels and some protocol data via the pinata farcaster hub api. Additional sources might be added in the future.

Some things that you can do very easily already with this library:

- Run a cli tool or a server that monitors and analyzes farcaster spam labels.
- Run a cli tool or a server that monitors follows and unfollows. You can also filter monitoring by spam labels.
- fetch and analyze like, recast, and cast times for any collection of fids, filtered or categorized by spam labels.
